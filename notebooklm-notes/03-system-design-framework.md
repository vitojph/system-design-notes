# Chapter 3: A Framework for System Design Interviews

## Listening overview

Use a repeatable interview process: clarify requirements and scope, agree on a high-level design, deep-dive into the important bottlenecks and trade-offs, then close with failure modes and future work.

# Chapter 3: A Framework for System Design Interviews

## Introduction

System design interviews are a key part of the hiring process, simulating real-life problem-solving scenarios. These interviews evaluate not just technical skills but also collaboration, communication, and the ability to handle ambiguous requirements.

This chapter introduces a **4-step framework** for navigating system design interviews effectively.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope

### Key Objectives

- Clarify requirements and assumptions.
- Avoid jumping into solutions prematurely.
- Showcase critical thinking by asking good questions.

### Approach

- **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
  - What are the most important features?
  - What scale does the system need to handle?
  - Are we building for web, mobile, or both?
  - Are there existing technologies or constraints?

- **Document Assumptions:** Write assumptions on a whiteboard or paper for reference.

### Example

**Problem:** Design a news feed system.  
**Questions:**

- Is it a mobile app, web app, or both?
- How many friends can a user have?
- Should the feed include images and videos?
- Is the feed sorted by reverse chronological order?

## Step 2: Propose High-Level Design and Get Buy-In

### Key Objectives

- Develop a high-level architecture.
- Collaborate with the interviewer to refine the design.

### Approach

- **Draft a Blueprint:**
  - Use box diagrams for key components (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caches, CDNs).
  - Treat the interviewer as a teammate to refine the design.

- **Perform Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations:**
  - Ensure the design can handle the scale constraints.

- **Walk Through Use Cases:** Identify edge cases and validate design assumptions.

### Example

For a news feed system, divide the design into:

1. **Feed Publishing Flow:** Writing posts into databases and populating friends' feeds.
2. **Feed Retrieval Flow:** Aggregating and displaying friends' posts in reverse chronological order.

---

## Step 3: Design Deep Dive

### Key Objectives

- Dive into critical components.
- Showcase depth of understanding and adaptability.

### Approach

- **Prioritize Key Components:** Focus on areas most relevant to the problem.
- **Discuss Bottlenecks:** Identify potential performance issues and propose solutions.
- **Balance Detail:** Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary deep dives.

### Example Topics

- **URL Shortener:** Focus on hash function design.
- **Chat System:** Explore latency reduction and online/offline status handling.
- **News Feed System:** Examine feed publishing and retrieval processes.

---

## Step 4: Wrap-Up

### Key Objectives

- Highlight areas for improvement.
- Recap the design and discuss follow-ups.

### Approach

- **Identify Bottlenecks:** Discuss potential limitations and scaling strategies.
- **Summarize Design:** Recap major design decisions and trade-offs.
- **Propose Enhancements:**
  - How to scale from 1 million to 10 million users.
  - Error handling for server failures or network issues.

---

## Best Practices

### Dos

- **Ask Questions:** Clarify ambiguities before diving into solutions.
- **Communicate:** Share your thought process with the interviewer.
- **Iterate with the Interviewer:** Treat them as a collaborator.
- **Show Flexibility:** Suggest alternative approaches and refine your design.
- **Focus on Critical Components:** Prioritize key parts of the system.

### Don’ts

- **Avoid Premature Solutions:** Don’t design before understanding the requirements.
- **Don’t Go Silent:** Communicate regularly during the process.
- **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Focus on practical, scalable solutions.

## Time Management

### Suggested Time Allocation (for 45-Minute Interviews)

1. **Understand Problem and Scope:** 3–10 minutes
2. **High-Level Design and Buy-In:** 10–15 minutes
3. **Deep Dive:** 10–25 minutes
4. **Wrap-Up:** 3–5 minutes
