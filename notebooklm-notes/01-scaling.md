# Chapter 1: Scale from Zero to Millions of Users

## Introduction

Scaling a system to support millions of users is a complex, iterative journey requiring refinement and optimization. This chapter outlines how to begin with a single server setup and scale the architecture step by step to handle millions of users.

---

## Section 1: Single Server Setup

Initially, all components (web app, database, cache) run on a single server.

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

### Request Flow

1. Users access the application via domain names (e.g., `api.mysite.com`), resolved to IP addresses using DNS.
2. IP address of the web-server is returned to the browser or mobile app.
3. HTTP requests are sent to the web server, which returns HTML or JSON responses.

### Traffic Sources

1. **Web Applications:** Use server-side languages (e.g., Python, Java) for business logic and client-side languages (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) for presentation.
2. **Mobile Applications:** Communicate with the web server using HTTP and JSON for lightweight data exchange.

---

## Section 2: Database Separation

As the user base grows, the database is moved to a dedicated server to allow independent scaling of web and database tiers.

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

### Database Choices

1. **Relational Databases (SQL):** Structured data stored in tables. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
2. **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):** Suitable for unstructured data or low-latency requirements. Categories include:
   - Key-Value Stores
   - Graph Databases
   - Column Stores
   - Document Stores

- Non-relational databases might be the right choice if:
  - application requires super-low latency.
  - data is unstructured, or there is no relational data.
  - only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.).
  - need to store a massive amount of data.

---

## Section 3: Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

### Vertical Scaling

- Adds more resources (CPU, RAM) to existing servers.
- Limited by hardware constraints and lacks redundancy.

### Horizontal Scaling

- Adds more servers to the pool, making it more suitable for large-scale systems.
- A load balancer is used to handle the request routing between the servers.

---

## Section 4: Load Balancer

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

A **load balancer** distributes traffic among multiple servers. Benefits include:

1. Redundancy: If a server goes offline, traffic is rerouted.
   - If server 1 goes offline, all the traffic will be routed to server 2.
2. Scalability: Easily add servers to handle traffic spikes.
   - If the website traffic grows rapidly, subsequent servers can be added to handle the additional traffic.

---

## Section 5: Database Replication

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

### Master-Slave Model

- **Master Database:** Handles write operations.
  - All the data-modifying commands like insert, delete, or update must be sent to the master database.
- **Slave Databases:** Handle read operations, improving performance and reliability.
  - Since the ratio of reads to writes is higher in most applications; thus, the number of slave
    databases in a system is usually larger than the number of master databases.

### Benefits

1. Improved performance through parallel read operations.
2. High availability and data reliability through redundancy.

### Failure Handling

- If only one slave database is available and it goes offline, read operations will be directed
  to the master database temporarily.
- In case multiple slave databases are available, read operations are
  redirected to other healthy slave databases and a new server will replace the old one.
- If the master database goes offline, a slave database will be promoted to be the new
  master.
- In production system the chosen slave database might not be up to date, hence data needs to be updated by running data
  recovery scripts (methods like multi-masters and circular replication could help).

## Section 6: Caching

A **cache** stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load. The cache tier is a temporary data store layer, much faster than the database.

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

### Caching considerations

1. **Use case**: Consider using cache when data is read frequently but modified infrequently.
2. **Expiration Policies:** Once cached data is expired, it is removed from the cache. When there is no expiration policy, cached
   data will be stored in the memory permanently.
3. **Consistency:** This means keeping the data store and the cache in sync. Inconsistency
   can happen because data-modifying operations on the data store and cache are not in a single transaction.
4. **Mitigating failures**: A single cache server represents a potential single point of failure, multiple
   cache servers across different data centers are recommended to avoid SPOF.
5. **Eviction Policies:**: Once the cache is full, items need to be evicted to free up memory. LRU is the most popular cache eviction policy.

---

## Section 7: Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A **CDN** improves load times by caching static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) on geographically distributed servers.

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

### Workflow

1. User requests content from the nearest CDN server.
2. If unavailable, content is fetched from the origin server and cached.

### CDN considerations

1. **Cost:** CDNs are run by third-party providers which charge for data transfers in and out of the CDN.
2. **Cache Expiry:** The cache expiry time should neither be too long nor too short.
3. **CDN fallback:** If there is a temporary CDN outage, clients should be able to detect the problem
   and request resources from the origin.
4. **Invalidating files:** If files are updated the cache should be invalidated to point to the updated files.

---

## Section 8: Stateless Web Tier

By moving session data to a shared datastore, web servers become stateless. This allows:

1. Easier horizontal scaling.
2. Auto-scaling based on traffic.

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

---

## Section 9: Multi-Data Center Setup

Deploying across multiple data centers improves availability and reduces latency. Strategies include:

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

1. **GeoDNS Routing:** Direct users to the nearest data center.
2. **Data Replication:** Synchronize data across centers to prevent inconsistencies.

### Key considerations

- **Traffic redirection:** Effective tools are needed to direct traffic to the correct data center.
- **Data synchronization:** A common strategy is to replicate data across multiple data centers.
- **Test and deployment:** Automated deployment tools are vital to keep services consistent through all the data centers.

---

## Section 10: Message Queue

A **message queue** is a durable component, stored in memory, that supports asynchronous
communication. It serves as a buffer and distributes asynchronous requests.

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

- Input services, called producers/publishers, create messages, and publish them to a message queue.
- Other services called consumers/subscribers, connect to the queue, and perform actions defined by the messages.

---

## Section 11: Logging, Metrics, and Automation

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

### Importance

1. **Logging:** Tracks errors and system health.
2. **Metrics:** Provides insights into performance and user activity.
3. **Automation:** Streamlines testing, deployment, and scaling.

---

## Section 12: Database Scaling

### Vertical Scaling

- Adds hardware resources but has physical and cost limitations.
- Has multiple drawbacks:
  - Greater risk of single point of failures.
  - Overall cost of vertical scaling is high

### Horizontal Scaling (Sharding)

> _Diagram described in the visual guide above._

- Divides data across multiple shards using keys (e.g., `user_id`).
  - Sharding separates large databases into smaller, more easily managed parts called shards.
  - Each shard shares the same schema, though the actual data on each shard is unique to the shard.
- Sharding key is critical when implementing a sharding strategy. When choosing a sharding key it is important to choose a key that can evenly distribute data.

#### Challenges

1. **Resharding data:** Resharding data is needed when:
   - Single shard could no longer hold more data due to rapid growth.
   - Certain shards might experience shard exhaustion faster than others due to uneven data distribution.
   - Consistent Hashing is used to overcome these problems

2. **Celebrity problem:** Excessive access to a specific shard could cause server overload.
   - To solve this problem, we may need to allocate a shard for each celebrity.

3. **Join and de-normalization:** Once a database has been sharded across multiple servers, it is hard to perform join operations across database shards.
   - A common workaround is to de-normalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table.

1. Keep the web tier stateless.
2. Build redundancy at every tier.
3. Use caching and CDNs to optimize performance.
4. Scale the data tier with sharding.
